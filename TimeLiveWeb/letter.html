I am writing to yourself today to express gratitude for exploring the Krooe system. The purpose being to explore the avenues of how and with what purpose time has in a 1st world society of today.<br><br>

The common phrase "Time is money" has been a perplexity of mine for sometime with regards to the logic side of the brain. How can something of a fixed sequence (time) and rotation be equivalent to a tangible asset (money). With a greater question pertaining to how if not money is time valued. Perhaps an annotation to our numeric system; whereby if time is money hence money is time. Thereby stating that each portion of our lives has a numeric value attached to it.<br><br>

This mindset I fear hinders itself to lose one of humanity greatest skills sets and propensity to inhibit exploration rather thought and ambiguity. How can a thought or time-lag be valued in the creation of a concept; hence a step to determine how does money equate to time.<br><br>

As such the system which should you choose to utilize become of some value, tasks and milestones (value) and time are attempted to be correlated by the following experimental formula:<br></p>
<h5 align=left style="padding-left: 300px; font-size: 12pt">
Time = [Milestone] / [Task]<br><br>

Units definitions:<br><br>

Time = time<br>
Milestone = unit / tasks<br>
Task = unit / time<br><br>

*Task can be singular or plural
</h5>
<p style="font-size: 12pt" align="Left">
Through use of the krooe system we hope that you bring a higher value to your own day and both the project owner, the team member and Krooe benefit.<br><br>

As of right now krooe is at no monetary cost to the user as it is still in its experimental stages. In the future when a sound methodolgy is created a charge per export of information will implemented in tandem with offering advertising space on issued data distributions to offset the immediate monetary cost from the user to an external body wishing to sell a good or grab a snippet of your time.<br><br>

Kind regards,<br><br>
